# Humans Detected

A website to bring attention to the documents that bring attention to the humans that make websites

---

## Motivation

In 2001, Carlos Ma≈Ñas, Maria Macias, Abel Cabans, Abel Sutilo and Juanjo Bernabeu started an initiative to bring more attention to the humans behind websites. If websites have a robots.txt, why not a humans.txt? In the ten years since humans.txt began, I'm not sure how much of a success it has been. That's not a coy way of claiming it was *not* a success. I'm really not sure how widely the humans.txt has been implemented. How many of the humans.txt files on the Internet are structured using [the standard] first used by [Abel Cabans]? How many are in a language other than English, and are there any multilingual humans.txts? How many have ASCII art? Dot-com is obviously going to have more humans.txts than any other TLD, but what about as a normalized rate?

## The Survey

A million thanks to Majestic for the [The Majestic Million], a free list of the top million domains. A comparable list from Alexa Top Sites would cost [$2500] USD. After thorough financial analysis, free was determined to be a better fit with the project's budget.

A million domains might sound like a good start, but it's not. It's not even one third of a percent of the nearly 360 million registered domains. Regardless, it is a start.

## The Approach

Based on some sketchy maths, I came up with the following estimates:

Manual Survey | 197 days
Single agent | 30 days
